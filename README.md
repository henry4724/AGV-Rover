Welcome to the LeaderBrand autonomous rover project. The goal of this project is to create a line of autonomous agriculture robots that can assist in tasks in the field. theses task include:

- Bird Scaring (Current objective)
- Mowing  (Future)
- Disease and Crop Monitoring   (Future)
- Spraying (Future)


## Quick Start

(Programming the PX)

(ardupilot settings) -- downlaod your file

(setting up RC)

(Mavproxy)




## Simulator
The simulator is build around Ardupilot's SITL simulator. SITL can be run alone but in this project it is used with ROS2 and Gazebo. The following guild will go thought the steps to set up the simulation. for more information about setting up the simulator visit the ardupilot website
